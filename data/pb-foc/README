We train and evaluate our model (focus detector) with the PB-FOC corpus which can be downloaded from *SEM 2012 Shared Task website. 
we also build a scope detector using CD-SCO corpus that is leveraged in focus detection.
We refer the readers to the *SEM 2012 Shared Task portal to know details about the corpora and evaluation procedure.

For convenience, we merge training and dev files to make a single file(e.g. SEM-2012-SharedTask-PB-FOC-tr_dev.merged).
The details on training, model selection, and evaluation results can be found in the paper "Predicting the Focus of Negation: Model and Error Analysis".
